Smart Electricity Meter
Real-time Electricity Usage Dashboard with Next.js

Overview
Smart Electricity Meter is a web-based dashboard designed to monitor and visualize real-time electricity consumption. Built primarily with Next.js and TypeScript, the project provides users with interactive charts, usage statistics, and insights to help manage and optimize their electricity consumption. The application is ideal for homeowners, building managers, and anyone interested in tracking energy usage efficiently.

Features
Real-time Data Visualization: View up-to-date electricity usage through dynamic charts and graphs.
Historical Analytics: Analyze past consumption patterns to identify trends and optimize usage.
User-Friendly Interface: Responsive and intuitive UI built with Next.js, leveraging modern web technologies.
Custom Alerts: Set thresholds to receive notifications when usage exceeds preset limits.
Device Integration: Supports integration with IoT-enabled electricity meters (Python scripts provided for backend data collection).
Secure & Scalable: Built with best practices for security and scalability, suitable for both personal and commercial deployments.
How It Works
Data Collection:
IoT-enabled smart meters collect electricity usage data and send it to the backend service, which is implemented in Python. This backend can connect with various meter hardware via standardized APIs.

Backend Processing:
The Python backend processes incoming data, performs necessary calculations, stores historical records, and exposes RESTful APIs for data retrieval.

Frontend Dashboard:
The Next.js frontend consumes these APIs and provides real-time charts and statistics. TypeScript ensures robust type safety, while HTML and CSS are used for layout and styling. Minimal JavaScript is used for custom interactivity.

User Interaction:
Users can log in, view their electricity usage, set alerts, and analyze consumption trends. The dashboard updates in real-time as new data arrives.

Technology Stack
Frontend:

Next.js (React-based framework)
TypeScript
HTML & CSS
JavaScript
Backend:

Python (REST APIs, data processing)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
npm
Python (for backend integration, optional if you only want to run the frontend)
Installation & Local Development
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinvvona/smart-electricity-meter.git
cd smart-electricity-meter
Install Dependencies

bash
npm install
Run the Development Server

bash
npm run dev
Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard.

Running the Backend (Optional)
If you want to simulate or connect to a real electricity meter, set up the Python backend:

Go to the backend directory (e.g., backend/ or server/ inside the project).

Install Python dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend server:

bash
python app.py
Refer to backend documentation for API endpoints and integration details.
